# Feature Requests

- [ ] Navigate Regions/Markers smoothly wihout navigating Regions twice
- [ ] Rename regions when inside region, not only at start
- [ ] Split up region and marker as renaming targets
- [ ] Auto-Fill form based on currentl selection
- [ ] Iterate and rename/update regions based on existing UCS data
    - Scenario: "When selecting items/regions both with UCS details and not, when renaming, could the script add UCS to the ones that miss it, and change and update the UCS on the ones that already have them? "
- [ ] Table of categories and their explanation
- [ ] Category History
- [ ] Load/Save presets
- [ ] Navigate modes with Ctrl+1,2,3 - Ctrl+F jumps to auto-search

# Bugs
- [x] Script freezes due to JS_Window_Find - use built in actions instead.
